                Access token and Refresh Token:
            </p>
            <p>An access token is like a special key that allows a computer program to access certain things, like a locked room or a website. It is given to the program after a user logs in or gives permission.
            A refresh token is also given to the program at the same time, and it's like a backup key. When the access token gets old and stops working, the program can use the refresh token to get a new access token without bothering the user to log in again. <br />

            So, access tokens and refresh tokens are like keys that let computer programs do certain things without needing to ask the user for permission all the time.</p>
            <br />
            <p className='font-semibold'>How they work: </p>
            <p>
            Access tokens and refresh tokens are like special keys that apps use to do things for you securely. The access token is given when you log in and lets the app access your information. If it expires, the app uses the refresh token to get a new access token without you logging in again. This way, you can use apps easily without always entering your password. The tokens help keep things safe and ensure only authorized apps can act on your behalf.

            Store access tokens and refresh tokens securely on the client-side, preferably in memory, to ensure their protection and prevent unauthorized access.

                <br />
                SQL databases are suitable for structured data with complex relationships and require strong consistency. NoSQL databases are more flexible, scalable, and handle unstructured or semi-structured data, prioritizing availability and scalability over strict consistency. The choice between SQL and NoSQL depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the data and the application.

                <p className='font-semibold'> MongoDB aggregate:</p>

                <p>MongoDB aggregate is a feature that allows you to perform advanced data processing tasks on collections. It uses a pipeline of stages to filter, group, sort, and transform data. Each stage performs a specific operation, such as matching documents, grouping them, or calculating aggregate values. It provides a flexible and powerful way to manipulate and analyze data within MongoDB collections.</p> <br />

                <p className='font-semibold'>How MongoDB works:</p>

                <p>
                In MongoDB, the aggregate function is a special tool used to analyze and change data in a collection. It works by following a set of steps, like a pipeline, to do different operations on the data. First, you can choose which documents to use based on specific conditions. Then, you can group the data and do calculations within each group. After that, you can use different operations to do things like counting, summing, or sorting. Finally, you can sort the results and choose how many to show. By using these steps, the aggregate function helps us analyze and get valuable information from our data in MongoDB.
